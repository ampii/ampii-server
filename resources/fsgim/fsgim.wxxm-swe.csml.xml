            A &quot;SamplingFeature&quot; is a feature used primarily for taking observations.
            Examples: a sounding typically samples a water- or atmospheric-column; a well samples an aquifer; a tissue specimen samples a part of an organism
            A SamplingFeature is distinguished from typical domain feature types in that it has a set of [0..*] navigable associations with Observations, given the rolename relatedObservation. 
            The SamplingFeature has an implicit set of properties corresponding to the observedProperty values of the related observations. 
            These properties may not be direct members of the sampledFeature, since the proximate observed property may require additional processing to obtain the value of the ultimate domain-feature property. 
            Sampling features are frequently related to each other, as parts of networks, through sub-sampling, etc. This is supported by the relatedSamplingFeature association with a generic SamplingFeatureRelation association class, which carries a source, target and role. 
            A common requirement for sampling features is an indication of the SurveyProcedure that provides the surveyDetails related to determination of its location and shape.
            Substitutability of SamplingFeature for AnyFeature is implied by the class stereotype &lt;&lt;FeatureType>>.

            A SamplingFeature is distinguished from typical domain feature types in that it has a set of [0..*] navigable associations with Observations, given the rolename relatedObservation. 
            This complements the association role “featureOfInterest” which is constrained to point back from the Observation to the Sampling-Feature. 
            The usual requirement of an Observation feature-of-interest is that its type has a property matching the observed-property on the Observation. 
            In the case of Sampling-features, the topology of the model and navigability of the relatedObservation role means that this requirement is satisfied automatically: 
            a property of the sampling-feature is implied by the observedProperty of a related observation. 
            This effectively provides an unlimited set of “soft-typed” properties on a Sampling Feature.
